    <h1>Bonifacio Day</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
Bonifacio Day is a national holiday in the Philippines that commemorates the birth of Andrés Bonifacio, the country's national hero. He was the founder and leader of the Katipunan, a secret society that sparked the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule in 1896 ¹.
</p>
<p>
Bonifacio is often referred to as the "Father of the Philippine Revolution" and is considered one of the most influential figures in Philippine history. He was born on November 30, 1863, which is why Bonifacio Day is celebrated annually on this date ².
</p>
<p>
However, in 2023, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed Proclamation 90, which moved the celebration of Bonifacio Day to the Monday nearest November 30, as part of the country's "holiday economics" strategy to promote domestic tourism ³.
</p>
<p>
Bonifacio Day is celebrated with various events and activities, including parades, cultural performances, and wreath-laying ceremonies at monuments dedicated to Bonifacio. It's a day to honor his legacy and reflect on the country's rich history and struggle for independence ⁴.
